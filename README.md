This repository shows my own implementation of some machine learning algorithms:
* Decision List
* Learn Decision Tree
* Logistic Regression
* Linear Regression
* Feed-forward Neural Network


Decision List and Decision Tree belong to the group of rule-based approaches, as they rely on if-then rules or conditions to make predictions.


Logistic Regression and Linear Regression belong to the group of linear models, as they assume a linear relationship between the input variables and the output variable.


Feed-forward Neural Network belongs to the group of neural network models, specifically a type of artificial neural network where information flows in one direction, from the input layer to the output layer.
