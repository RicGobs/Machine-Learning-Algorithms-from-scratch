# Linear Regression

Linear regression is used to predict the value of one variable based on the value of another variable.
The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the value of the other variable is
called independent variable.
In my implementation of linear regression I used MSE (Mean Squared Error) as a cost and Gradient Descent as an optimization method.
