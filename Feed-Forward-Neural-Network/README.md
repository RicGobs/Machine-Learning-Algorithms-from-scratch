# Feed Forward Neural Network

Implementation of a Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) where the hyperparameters are:
1. The number of neurons per hidden layer. For example n_neurons = [10, 20, 10] means I have three hidden layers with 10, 20, and 10 neurons in each hidden layer.
2. The number of hidden layers which, however, is implicitly inferred by n_neurons.
3. SGD's learning ratio.
The code was built from other community codes and insights, so I don't own this code.
